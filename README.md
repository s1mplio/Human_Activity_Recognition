## 🔍 Project Highlights

- 📉 **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce noise and compress sensor data.
- 🤖 **Model Training**: Used a **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** to classify activities like walking, sitting, and standing.
- 🎯 **Accuracy Achieved**: **95%** on test data.
- 🧠 **Goal**: Enhance the performance of activity detection in fitness tracking apps.
